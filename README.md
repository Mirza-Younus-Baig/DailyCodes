# DailyCodes
This repository contains the daily codes that I do. 
I have taken this into consideration that I should improve my skills and build myself to tackle any problems related to programming. I came acrros this beautiful site called <em>https://codetoexpress.tech</em>  where I saw the two month long coding practice. 


<h3>Objectives and Expected Outcomes</h3>
<p>I aim at becoming good at some codig concepts and develop a good rapport with other fellow learners.</p>
